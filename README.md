# NoRecoilScriptv2.1-Finished-
RuthNoRecoil is a personal challenge just to create a no recoil script, to extend my knowledge.

The published version (v2.1) is not finalized at the moment.

I update the code as I advance the project and it is open so that anyone who wants to read the code and modify it can do so.

At the end of this version I will continue working on the next one where I will insert a menu of weapons for each game, so that when you click, the recoil values 
are injected directly.

Also an image recognition system in a specific area of the screen where weapons will be recognized and recoil values 
will also be added. In this way, if you pick up a weapon from the ground, the specified values will be added if they are specified.
